# MNIST-Classification-DeepNet
A Jupyter Notebook with Neural Network for the MNIST Classification

This is a MNIST Classification Machine Learning model that i built myself using TensorFlow. This model is used to predict the handwritten digits and classify them between 0-9. This particular model has an accuracy of 98%.

The datasets used here are readily avilable at [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist)
